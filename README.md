## Explain the fundamental concepts of version control and why GitHub is a popular tool for managing versions of code. How does version control help in maintaining project integrity?
-**Fundamental Concepts of Version Control**
Version Control systems are essential tools for managing changes to files over time, especially in collaborative environments. Here are the core concepts:
Repository: A storage location for project files and their history. Repositories can be local (on your computer) or remote (on a server).
-**Commit:** A snapshot of the project at a particular point in time. Each commit has a unique identifier and includes a description of the changes made.
-**Branch:** A separate line of development that allows you to work on features or fixes without affecting the main codebase. Commonly used branches include main (or master) and feature branches.
-**Merge:** The process of integrating changes from one branch into another. Merging combines different lines of development and resolves conflicts.
Pull Request (PR): A proposal to merge changes from one branch into another. It allows for code review and discussion before integration.
-**Conflict:** Occurs when changes from different branches cannot be automatically reconciled. Manual resolution is required to merge conflicting changes.
-**Checkout:** The action of switching to a specific branch or commit. It allows you to work with different versions of the project.
-**Log:** A history of commits that shows what changes were made and when. It helps in tracking project evolution and understanding the context of changes.
- ### Why GitHub is Popular for Managing Versions of Code
